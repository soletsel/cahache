Cache Hache

WHAT? <br />
An executable that deletes a designated directory.<br />
Helps to delete cache and other crap that are generated regularly in obscure paths.

HOW? <br />
Download as-is or use the powershell script to make your own changes.<br />
For the former, just run it, specify folder to delete, and press Go.<br />
For the latter, there are open source tools such as PS2EXE to generate the executable.<br />
<br />
An example is generated for SolidWorks on 3D Experience platform.<br />

WHY? <br />
Sometimes in life we are forced to use a poorly designed software that generates crap and will not run unless you wipe its mess.<br />
Simplifying that process down to a double-click makes for a somewhat bearable experience.<br />
