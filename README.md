Cache Hache

[What is it?]
An executable that deletes a designated directory. Helps to delete cache and other crap that are generated regularly in obscure paths.

[How to use it?]
Download as-is or use the powershell script to make your own changes.
For the former, just run it, specify folder to delete, and press Go.
For the latter, there are open source tools such as PS2EXE to generate the executable.

An example is generated for SolidWorks on 3D Experience platform.

[Why was it made?]
Sometimes in life we are forced to use a poorly designed software that generates crap and will not run unless you wipe its mess.
Simplifying that process down to a double-click makes for a somewhat bearable experience.
